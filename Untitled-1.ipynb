This then caused theft of sensitive data over a five year time period and over 4.5 million patients were involved during 2014. Many ethical issues are involved due to the huge breach like the leak of social security, names, birthdates, addresses and more sensitive information. This also opens the idea that they should have been aware of the possible warning signs from someone breaching their data and privacy. "
